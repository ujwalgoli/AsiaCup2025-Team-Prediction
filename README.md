# 🏏 Cricket Playing XI Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **Possible Playing XI for the Indian Cricket Team** using **machine learning models** based on player statistics (T20 & ODI).  
We applied data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and final prediction with role-based team selection.  

The final output recommends a **balanced Playing XI** (Batsmen, All-rounders, Bowlers, Wicketkeepers), highlighting the **Captain (C)** and **Vice-Captain (VC)** in a clean visual lineup.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Insertion** – Load player stats (T20, ODI).  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, create derived features.  
3. **Exploratory Visualization** – Charts and plots to understand distributions.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Train Random Forest & compare with Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.  
5. **Model Comparison** – Accuracy & F1-score comparison with bar plots.  
6. **Feature Importance** – Identify key features influencing selection.  
7. **Final Prediction** – Generate Playing XI using the trained XGBoost model.  
8. **Team Visualization** – Vertical lineup with role-based colored blocks, highlighting Captain & Vice-Captain.
